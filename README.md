# userChrome.css #

These userChrome.css files for Mozilla Firefox help to easily distinguish the level of privacy offered by the Firefox profile used.

userChrome-advanced-privacy.css is intended to be used with the advanced privacy bundle and userChrome-basic-privacy.css goes with the basic privacy bundle proposed in our article on [customizing privacy settings in Mozilla Firefox using add-ons](https://webdevelopmentaid.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/customize-privacy-settings-in-mozilla-firefox-part-2-add-ons/ "Customize Privacy Settings in Mozilla Firefox: Part 2 (Add-ons) | WebDevelopmentAid")

## Installation ##
Click "Download ZIP" to download the folder, extract the file "userChrome.css" from the ZIP, copy the file "chrome" (or its content, respectively) to your Firefox profile.

### Windows ###
Under Windows (tested for Windows 7, 8, 8.1) you will find your Firefox profile at C:\Users\\\[USERNAME\]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\\\[PROFILENAME\]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. JohnDoe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default). When using the File Explorer you might have to make visible your hidden folders.

If you already have a folder "chrome" in your Firefox profile, copy the **content** of the downloaded and extracted "searchplugins" folder and paste it to your "chrome" folder of your Firefox profile.

If you do not have a folder "chrome" in your Firefox profile, copy the downloaded and extracted "chrome" **folder** and paste it to your Firefox profile.

### Linux ###
Under Linux (tested for Debian-based Crunchbang 11) you will find your Firefox profile at /home/[USERNAME]/.mozilla/firefox/[PROFILENAME]) where [USERNAME] is replaced by your user name (e.g. JohnDoe) and [PROFILENAME] is replaced by the name of your Firefox profile (e.g. floou2ja.Default). When using the File Manager you might have to make visible your hidden folders.

If you already have a folder "chrome" in your Firefox profile, copy the **content** of the downloaded and extracted "searchplugins" folder and paste it to your "searchplugins" folder of your Firefox profile.

If you do not have a folder "chrome" in your Firefox profile, copy the downloaded and extracted "chrome" **folder** and paste it to your Firefox profile.
